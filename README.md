Fluff is a fork of [Sangou](https://github.com/dfault-user/fluff), which is a fork of [robocop-ng](https://github.com/reswitched/robocop-ng). 

This fork was created by Marr and @dfault-user for the original Undertale Discord server to work with Atora's bots, Tol and Smol.

This bot takes on the persona of a bunny and is based off one of Marr's real bunnies with the same name and appearance (less botty, though.)

# Usage

Fluff is currently not available for public use, but self-hosting instructions are available below. However, be mindful there are some things that hard-code to the Undertale Discord server. All command documentation currently heeds to [Sangou's original documentation](https://3gou.0ccu.lt/).

- Download the bot from this repository. Stick to the release versions unless you have encountered a bug.
- Install [pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/).
- Use `pipenv install` in the root folder, where `Pipfile` is.
- Copy `config.example.py` to `config.py`, and fill it out with your bot information.
- Enter `pipenv shell`, `cd fluff`, then `python __init__.py`.
- Congratulations.

Also, neither of us know anything about Python and this bot is the equivelant of the [infinite monkey theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem), so you might not want to ask us for help regardless.
